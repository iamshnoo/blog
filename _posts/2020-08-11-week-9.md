> The beginning of the end.

Well, not in a dark way, of course. But yeah, this was the first week of the
last month of the coding phase for GSoC. So, in that sense, yeah ðŸ˜…

The week started with a reminder from Google that I needed to pack up things
nicely and be able to present it by the end of this month, or as they term it,
*Work Product Submission*. Now, in my case, I had been maintaining a personal
repository with demonstrations, notebooks and all other code files that I have
used throughout GSoC to produce the features and blogs. However, the
[repository](https://github.com/iamshnoo/mlpack-testing) was not very
well-maintained, in the sense that it lacked clear READMEs for the different
sections. So, my first task this week was to restructure the repository
properly, so that I can present it directly as *The* "Work Product". The image
you see above is just a little something I added to the homepage README to make
the repository feel a bit more personal (and cool)! Anyway, now that that is
done, any feedback on the repository would be really welcome.

Apart from that, I opened PRs for the 3 features I had worked on during the
second phase, namely Instance Norm, Pixel Shuffle and Spatial Dropout. I ran
into some unexpected errors and issues while doing this, which took up a lot of
time.The Gradient Test for Instance Norm fails. More precisely, the test crashes
after throwing some memory error, which I am unable to understand. Apart from
that, the Doxygen builds for Pixel Shuffle and Spatial Dropout fail, saying that
there is no documentation for the ```Backward()``` method of those layers, when
there clearly is! Maybe I am reading the build error message incorrectly. Would
need to look at it more closely/ ask mentors about this. Anyway, these are the
areas I need a little bit of help with. The rest of the proposed work for
Phase 1 and Phase 2 is complete, at least in concept. Obviously, with all the
major changes going on, with the Catch2 refactoring and all, I am having
constant merge conflicts in all the branches, so those would need to be taken
care of before any of these can be merged.

***@birm*** merged one of my inital PRs on Soft Margin Loss a couple of weeks
back. That was nice! I have been meaning to mention this in the blog since then,
but I just keep forgetting.

In Week 10, I am mainly trying to understand the code that is present in the
mlpack-TensorFlow-Translator, so that I can make the changes I proposed for it
correctly, hopefully by next week.

Coming to fun stuff done this week, I learnt how to make pudding properly this
week. I know it is probably very easy for someone who knows how to cook. But for
me, this was big, mainly because the only other thing I know is how to boil
eggs. So, yeah, it was a pretty steep learning curve, an enjoyable one
nonetheless.

I watched the movie ***Mortal*** which was released this year. Its a pretty
interesting take on Thor, the Norse God of Thunder. The scenery shots in it
absolutely will remind you of the fact that you are stuck in home in the middle
of an unending lockdown, and that beautiful places still exist outside of those
4 walls.

Song recommendation for the week will be an old favourite of mine which I played
on rewind more than usual this week.
